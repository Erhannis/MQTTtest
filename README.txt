Test code for M2Mqtt4Unity, old and unsupported and only one link still working, but the only thing I've found that allows Unity code to connect to an MQTT server.  Oh, the dll I found at https://m2mqtt4unity.codeplex.com/releases/view/167009

This is released under the MIT license.  Frankly, I don't know what license M2Mqtt4Unity was released under; its site didn't say, and the source download was gone.  It was supposedly open source, though.

Oh, I guess I also included SteamVR.  I was gonna send controller data, but, ah, "reduced scope", and decided that it sending any kind of message at all was a sufficient test.
